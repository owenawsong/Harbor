# Harbor — AI Browser Agent

> **Real AI agent powers for your browser. No new browser, no AI wrapper—just pure automation.**

A Chrome extension that gives you a real AI agent inside your browser. Not a chatbot. Not another browser. An intelligent agent that **reads pages, clicks buttons, fills forms, finds information, and automates tasks** across any website.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

Harbor uses AI to understand what you want, then **actually controls your browser**. Give it a task in natural language, and it:

- ✅ Navigates to websites
- ✅ Clicks buttons and fills forms
- ✅ Extracts and summarizes information
- ✅ Manages tabs, windows, bookmarks
- ✅ Downloads files
- ✅ Executes complex workflows
- ✅ **Works with ANY AI model** you choose

### Real Examples

```
"Search GitHub for trending AI repos and open the top 3 in new tabs"
→ Harbor opens GitHub, searches, and opens 3 tabs automatically

"Find the cheapest flight from NYC to London in March and compare prices"
→ Harbor searches multiple sites and compares prices in real-time

"Fill out this form with my contact info and address from my profile"
→ Harbor reads your profile and auto-fills the form

"Summarize all content on this page and save it as a PDF bookmark"
→ Harbor extracts, summarizes, and saves—all in one step

"Monitor this stock price and alert me when it drops 5%"
→ Harbor runs scheduled checks and notifies you
```

## 🎯 Why Harbor?

### vs. **Perplexity Comet & GPT Atlas**
- ✅ **Open-source** — Full control, no vendor lock-in
- ✅ **Your AI choice** — Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Ollama, or any model
- ✅ **Privacy-first** — API keys stay in your browser, nothing sent to servers
- ✅ **Works everywhere** — Not limited to Perplexity or specific models
- ❌ Comet may collect browsing data; Atlas is Mac-only with usage limits

### vs. **Standard Chatbots** (ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini)
- ✅ **Actually controls your browser** — Not just text responses
- ✅ **Always available** — No tab switching or copy/paste
- ✅ **Real-time web access** — Sees live prices, updates, content
- ✅ **Task automation** — Handles complex multi-step workflows
- ❌ Chatbots can only tell you what to do; Harbor actually does it

### vs. **Regular Browser Extensions**
- ✅ **Genuinely intelligent** — Understands context and intent
- ✅ **No repetitive configs** — One setup, works everywhere
- ✅ **Adaptive** — Handles page changes, finds elements dynamically
- ❌ Other extensions need specific rules for every site

## 🏗️ Architecture

Harbor is a **Chrome Manifest V3 extension** built with React and TypeScript:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Side Panel UI (React)             │  ← Chat interface, settings, memory
│   └─ Chat, Settings, History        │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↕ (Messages)
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Service Worker (background.js)    │  ← Agent loop, AI calls, orchestration
│   └─ Agent loop, tool execution     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↕ (DOM control)
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Content Script (content.js)       │  ← DOM interaction, page control
│   └─ Click, type, screenshot        │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How It Works:**
1. You type a message in the side panel
2. Service worker sends it to your chosen AI provider with available tools
3. AI responds with tool calls (e.g., "click button #submit")
4. Content script executes tool calls on the page
5. Screenshots/results are sent back to AI for next step
6. Process repeats until task is complete
7. Final response is streamed back to you
